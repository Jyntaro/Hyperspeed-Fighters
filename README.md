-------THIS GAME IS NOT FOR SALE AND NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE--------

Currently, the game contains 2 enemy types and a 60 second time attack
scoring system. The player aims with their mouse and clicks on the enemies
to destroy them and are rewarded points based on the reaction time.

Continual development of this game in the future is planned:
1) Add more enemy types and more variety
2) Optimization to decrease input lag issues
3) Create a deeper, more immersive experience through better assets
4) Develop a trackable scoring system (local)
5) Successfully port with Processing.js (failed first time)

Assets are taken from online sites that share these assets for free.
